# Contributor's Guide for the RAG Cookbook
**Contributor's Guide for the RAG Cookbook with GitHub Issue and PR Pipeline**

Welcome to the contributor’s guide for the RAG Cookbook, where your expertise can help shape a comprehensive resource for AI engineers interested in Retrieval-Augmented Generation. This guide outlines how to contribute using GitHub, focusing on issues and pull requests (PRs).

**Getting Started with GitHub**

- **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the RAG Cookbook repository on GitHub. This creates a personal copy where you can make changes without affecting the original codebase.
- **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine to start working on the content or code.

**Using GitHub Issues**

- **Submit an Issue**: If you identify a gap, error, or potential enhancement, submit an issue on GitHub. Provide a clear, concise title and a detailed description of the issue, including examples or references as necessary.
- **Issue Discussion**: Engage with other contributors and maintainers in the issue discussion to refine the idea or address the problem. This collaboration can help clarify the scope and requirements of the contribution.

**Preparing Your Contribution**

- **Create a New Branch**: For each contribution, create a new branch in your forked repository. Use a name that reflects the nature of your contribution, such as `feature-enhanced-examples` or `fix-typo-chapter-3`.
- **Develop Your Contribution**: Work on your contribution, following the RAG Cookbook's style and guidelines. For code, ensure it is well-commented and adheres to the coding standards.

**Submitting a Pull Request (PR)**

- **Push Your Changes**: Once your contribution is ready, push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
- **Create a Pull Request**: From your repository, initiate a PR to the main RAG Cookbook repository. Provide a clear, detailed description of your changes, referencing any related issues.
- **Review Process**: The maintainers will review your PR. Participate in the review process by responding to comments and making necessary revisions. This collaborative process ensures the contribution is aligned with the project’s standards and goals.

**After Your PR is Merged**

- **Follow Up**: After your PR is merged, it’s good practice to pull the changes to your local repository and delete the feature branch both locally and on GitHub to keep your workspace clean and up-to-date.
- **Stay Engaged**: Continue to monitor the project for new issues, updates, and discussions. Your ongoing involvement can contribute to the continuous improvement of the RAG Cookbook.

**Contributor Recognition**

- **Acknowledgment**: Contributors who have successfully merged PRs will be acknowledged in the project’s documentation or a dedicated contributors’ list, highlighting the community-driven effort behind the RAG Cookbook.

By following these steps, you can effectively contribute to the RAG Cookbook using GitHub’s issue and PR pipeline, fostering a collaborative and dynamic community of AI professionals dedicated to advancing the field of Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
